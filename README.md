## Abstract

Ensuring architectural conformance is a key challenge in software engineering. This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate **design conformance tests** directly from **natural language design rules**, typically expressed in development discussions (e.g., code reviews, issues). Our approach avoids the need for formal architecture specifications by leveraging informal communication and transforming it into executable design tests using the [Design Wizard](https://github.com/joaoarthurbm/designwizard) library.

## Python Requirements Installation

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment (e.g., with `venv`):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Pipeline

### 1. Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector

You must be running a PostgreSQL database with `pgvector` support. To start a container with the required setup:

```bash
docker run --name pgvector-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=designwizard_docs \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d pgvector/pgvector:pg16
````

Make sure to configure your `.env` or environment variables to match the credentials used above.

---

### 2. Ingest Design Wizard documentation

The documentation used for the RAG pipeline is located in `data/doc/`. To store it in the database as vector embeddings, run:

```bash
python scripts/vector_creation.py
```

---

### 3. Generate Natural Language Rules

To generate design rules in natural language from real-world discussion examples:

```bash
python scripts/rule_generator.py
```

The result will be saved in `output/rules.txt`.

> **Note:** Not all rules generated by the LLM are used in the study. You must manually select which rules will be used in the next steps.

> **Tip:** The prompt at the beginning of `scripts/rule_generator.py` can be modified to generate rules for any of the 6 design patterns in the study (Strategy, Facade, Simple Factory, Composite, Adapter, Builder).

---

### 4. Select and Add Rules for Test Generation

After manually selecting the desired rules (from `output/rules.txt`), add them as an array named `rules` in the file `scripts/query.py`:

```python
rules = [
    "Rule 1...",
    "Rule 2...",
    # ...
]
```

The script will iterate over this array and generate a design test for each rule. The generated tests (model output) will be saved in a file in the `output` folder, named `saida-{date and time of execution}.txt`.

---

### 5. Execute the Generated Design Tests

To execute the generated design tests:

1. Copy the Java test code(s) from the output file in `output/saida-{date and time}.txt`.
2. Paste the code into `src/test/DesignTest.java` inside the `codebase` folder corresponding to the chosen design pattern.
3. Compile and run using the Java commands already described in the next step.

---

## Evaluation Setup

We used the [DesignPatterns](https://github.com/clarck/DesignPatterns) repository to validate generated tests.

### Java Code Compilation & Execution

1. Navigate into a specific design pattern folder inside `codebase/`.
2. Compile with:

```bash
javac -d bin -cp "lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;lib/designwizard-1.4.jar;." src/test/*.java src/com/cnblog/clarck/*.java
```

3. Execute with:

```bash
java -cp "lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;lib/designwizard-1.4.jar;bin;." org.junit.runner.JUnitCore test.DesignTest
```
